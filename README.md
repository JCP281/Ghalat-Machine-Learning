<h1>GML - Ghalat Machine Learning!</h1>

<b>Tired of training multiple models and then picking the best among them? No worries now! GML is here for you!</b>
<br>
<br>
GML is an automatic machine learning library in python built on top of Scikit-Learn,Keras,XGBoost,LightGBM and Catboost. with this library, you can train your data on multiple machine learning algorithms and a neural network! not only training but scaling the data for normal distribution and after scaling and training, testing the data on validation data (don't worry you don't need to provide validation data. we will extract it from your data). after testing models on validation data, they will be ranked accordingly and you will see which one performs better than other. the first ranked model will be returned (untrained, so you can train it yourself and check results) <br>
  <br>
In future updates many other things will also be automated like hyper parameter training, multiple neural networks, other machine learning algorithms and many more cool things!
